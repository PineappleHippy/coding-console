5. Future Expansion

	1.	Adding New Commands:
	•	Add new command files to the commands directory as needed. Update commandCenter.java or create new files for additional functionality.
	2.	Adapt for Other Languages:
	•	Follow a similar approach for different languages. Create corresponding files and command structures for Python, C, or other languages you plan to learn.
	3.	Maintain Flexibility:
	•	Organize your commands and utilities in a way that allows easy addition and modification. Use GitHub’s version control to track changes and manage different versions.
